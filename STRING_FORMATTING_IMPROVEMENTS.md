# String Formatting Improvements for PSeInt LSP Formatter

## Summary

This update significantly improves the PSeInt formatter's handling of string literals, ensuring that content inside strings is preserved exactly while still applying proper formatting to code outside of strings.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Whitespace Collapsing in Strings**
- **Problem**: Multiple spaces inside strings were being collapsed to single spaces
- **Example**: `"   Text   "` became `" Text "`
- **Solution**: Implemented string-aware formatting that preserves internal whitespace

### 2. **Operator Spacing in Strings** 
- **Problem**: The formatter was applying operator spacing rules inside strings
- **Example**: `"x<-y+z"` became `"x <- y + z"`
- **Solution**: Created helper functions that only apply formatting outside string literals

### 3. **Comma Spacing in Strings**
- **Problem**: Commas inside strings were getting spaces added after them
- **Example**: `"One,Two,Three"` became `"One, Two, Three"`
- **Solution**: Protected string contents from punctuation formatting

### 4. **ASCII Art Preservation**
- **Problem**: Complex ASCII art in strings was being mangled
- **Example**: ASCII logos and visual elements were broken
- **Solution**: Complete preservation of string content including special characters

## Technical Implementation

### New Helper Functions

1. **`apply_keyword_casing_outside_strings()`**
   - Applies proper keyword casing only to code outside string literals
   - Preserves case inside strings exactly as written

2. **`apply_keyword_spacing_outside_strings()`**
   - Adds proper spacing after keywords only outside strings
   - Ensures keywords like "Escribir" get proper spacing before quotes

3. **`apply_operator_spacing_outside_strings()`**
   - Applies operator spacing (e.g., `<-`, `=`, `+`) only outside strings
   - Protects mathematical expressions inside strings

4. **`apply_punctuation_spacing_outside_strings()`**
   - Handles comma and parentheses spacing only outside strings
   - Preserves punctuation patterns in strings

5. **`normalize_whitespace_outside_strings()`**
   - Normalizes multiple spaces to single spaces only outside strings
   - Preserves intentional whitespace patterns in strings

6. **`fix_caso_statements_outside_strings()`**
   - Fixes Caso statement formatting (removes spaces after commas) only outside strings
   - Improved to handle multiple comma-separated values like `Caso 1,2,3:`

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_string_formatting.py` with 16 test cases covering:

- ✅ Simple string preservation
- ✅ Strings containing PSeInt keywords
- ✅ ASCII art strings with special characters
- ✅ Strings with mixed quotes
- ✅ Strings with operators and mathematical expressions
- ✅ Strings with punctuation patterns
- ✅ Long strings with whitespace patterns
- ✅ Empty strings
- ✅ String assignments to arrays
- ✅ Complex mixed code and string scenarios
- ✅ Escaped quotes handling
- ✅ Real-world examples from reference code
- ✅ Caso statements with inline code

## Validation

The improvements were validated against the actual reference code (`reference_code/reference_code1.psc`) which contains:

- Complex ASCII art logos
- Long strings with specific whitespace patterns
- University information with precise formatting
- Multi-line visual elements
- Special Unicode characters

**Result**: ✅ All critical strings preserved exactly, while code formatting remains correct.

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to the public API
- ✅ Maintains proper indentation and keyword formatting
- ✅ Existing tests continue to pass (with minor test updates for improved behavior)

## Benefits

1. **Professional Output**: ASCII art and visual elements in PSeInt code remain intact
2. **Data Integrity**: String data is never corrupted during formatting
3. **Mixed Content**: Complex code mixing strings and operators formats correctly
4. **Unicode Support**: Handles special characters and encoding variations
5. **Performance**: Efficient string parsing with minimal overhead

This enhancement makes the PSeInt LSP formatter production-ready for real-world PSeInt codebases that contain complex string content.
